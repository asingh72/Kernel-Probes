The makefile will compile the jprobe programs. 

(A) To execute the makefile run the command:

=> make

(B) To execute the kernel program and insert module execute the following command:

=> sudo insmod jp.ko pid=<pid of the program>

and following is the screenshot for three different target applications

¬	Kprobes enables you to dynamically break into any kernel routine and collect debugging and performance information non-disruptively. You can trap at almost any kernel code address(*), specifying a handler routine to be invoked when the breakpoint is hit.
¬	For I/O when file is starts reading, at that movement we get more page fault.
¬	If bus mode we usually get Compute module.
